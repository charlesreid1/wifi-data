# Internet of Things Wireless Sensor Data Project

Welcome to the repository for the Internet of Things Wireless Network Data project. 
This project is part of an undergraduate research project at South Seattle College.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will be operating an internet of things sensor.
Specifically, this will be a Raspberry Pi with a directional Wifi antenna.
The Raspberry Pi will collect wifi signal data.

This data will be collected on a server, and processed and analyzed.
As part of the proejct we will be looking at the time-evolving picture
of wireless network traffic in a given location.

## Code Overview

The breakdown of tasks:
* Control antenna rotator and wifi antenna
* Collect wifi data onboard the sensor
* Copy data to C2 server
* Process CSV files
